## Features :hammer_and_wrench:
- Orders can be uoloaded via CSV file
- Visual Anaylytics to delay distribution and predicted delay days
- Summary tables by courier and city
- Interactive map of delivery delays by destination city
- Ready to download CSV file containing prediction of delay in days and delay level
